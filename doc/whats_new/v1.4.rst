Version 1.4.0
=============

Changed models
--------------

The following estimators and functions, when fit with the same data and
parameters, may produce different models from the previous version. This often
occurs due to changes in the modelling logic (bug fixes or enhancements), or in
random sampling procedures.

Changes impacting all modules
-----------------------------

- |Enhancement| All estimators now recognizes the column names from any dataframe
  that adopts the
  `DataFrame Interchange Protocol <https://data-apis.org/dataframe-protocol/latest/purpose_and_scope.html>`__.
  Dataframes that return a correct representation through `np.asarray(df)` is expected
  to work with our estimators and functions.
  :pr:`26464` by `Thomas Fan`_.

Changelog
---------

..
    Entries should be grouped by module (in alphabetic order) and prefixed with
    one of the labels: |MajorFeature|, |Feature|, |Efficiency|, |Enhancement|,
    |Fix| or |API| (see whats_new.rst for descriptions).
    Entries should be ordered by those labels (e.g. |Fix| after |Efficiency|).
    Changes not specific to a module should be listed under *Multiple Modules*
    or *Miscellaneous*.
    Entries should end with:
    :pr:`123456` by :user:`Joe Bloggs <joeongithub>`.
    where 123456 is the *pull request* number, not the issue number.

:mod:`sklearn.base`
...................

- |Enhancement| :meth:`base.ClusterMixin.fit_predict` and
  :meth:`base.OutlierMixin.fit_predict` now accept ``**kwargs`` which are
  passed to the ``fit`` method of the the estimator. :pr:`26506` by `Adrin
  Jalali`_.

:mod:`sklearn.decomposition`
............................

- |Enhancement| An "auto" option was added to the `n_components` parameter of
  :func:`decomposition.non_negative_factorization`, :class:`decomposition.NMF` and
  :class:`decomposition.MiniBatchNMF` to automatically infer the number of components from W or H shapes
  when using a custom initialization. The default value of this parameter will change
  from `None` to `auto` in version 1.6.
  :pr:`26634` by :user:`Alexandre Landeau <AlexL>` and :user:`Alexandre Vigny <avigny>`.

:mod:`sklearn.ensemble`
.......................

- |Feature| :class:`ensemble.RandomForestClassifier`,
  :class:`ensemble.RandomForestRegressor`, :class:`ensemble.ExtraTreesClassifier`
  and :class:`ensemble.ExtraTreesRegressor` now support monotonic constraints,
  useful when features are supposed to have a positive/negative effect on the target.
  Missing values in the train data and multi-output targets are not supported.
  :pr:`13649` by :user:`Samuel Ronsin <samronsin>`,
  initiated by :user:`Patrick O'Reilly <pat-oreilly>`.

:mod:`sklearn.feature_selection`
................................

- |Fix| :func:`feature_selection.mutual_info_regression` now correctly computes the
  result when `X` is of integer dtype. :pr:`26748` by :user:`Yao Xiao <Charlie-XIAO>`.

:mod:`sklearn.tree`
...................

- |Feature| :class:`tree.DecisionTreeClassifier`, :class:`tree.DecisionTreeRegressor`,
  :class:`tree.ExtraTreeClassifier` and :class:`tree.ExtraTreeRegressor` now support
  monotonic constraints, useful when features are supposed to have a positive/negative
  effect on the target. Missing values in the train data and multi-output targets are
  not supported.
  :pr:`13649` by :user:`Samuel Ronsin <samronsin>`, initiated by
  :user:`Patrick O'Reilly <pat-oreilly>`.
